  <h2>Visual note-taking for conferences and important meetings</h2>
  <p>You've got a bunch of smart people together and you put them on a stage. Don't let their best ideas turn into a pages of scribbled notes that are never looked at again.</p>
  <p>Sure you can share the slides but most slides are boring, plus the magic is in the speaker and their delivery. Videos are cool if you want to go to the effort, but your audience has to fast forward to see the key points.</p>
  <h3>Capture fresh thinking and inspiring quotes as visual notes</h3>
  <p>Visual notes are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>More interesting to look at</li>
    <li>More enjoyable to review</li>
    <li>Easily understood at a glance</li>
    <li>More likely to live on compared to a list of bullets.</li>
    <li>Easily shared via social media</li>
    <li>A great value add for your audience</li>
    <li>Awesome posters around the office!</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>How it works</h3>
  <p>You let me know when your conference or meeting is on. On the day I just need a place to sit with power and some free wi-fi.</p>
  <p>I watch, listen and draw visual notes of key points and interesting ideas. For example, if everyone laughs about something then I'll draw whatever that was.</p>
  <p>I share pictures via Dropbox or email as I draw and someone on your team can share them on your social networks (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, etc).</p>
  <h3>What you get</h3>
  <p>Within 48 hours after the conference you get:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Hi-res the images to download</li>
    <li>A3 posters of up to 10 of your favourite visual notes</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Plus</strong>, I can teach everyone how take visual notes at the start of your conference (optional extra)</p>

  <h3>Cost</h3>
  <p>$500 for half day or $750 for a full day of visual note-taking, hi-res images and A3 posters.</p>
  <p>+ $100 for a 30 minute visual note-taking lesson for your audience.</p>
