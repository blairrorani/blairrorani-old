<h2>Hi I'm Blair Rorani</h2>
</p>When you’re explaining some new technology, the default is to use crowded PowerPoint slides, boring technical overviews and jargon-filled emails. <i class="em em-cry"></i></p>

<p><strong>What if you had a simple, easy way to explain new technology to your customers, staff and stakeholders?</strong></p>

<p>I help organsiations to visualise and explain the who, what, why and how of their digital transformation.</p>

<blockquote>
Blair's ability as a visual thinker is exceptional. His skill to take complex information an distil it down to a visual graphic is like watching a magician.<br />(Rhys F, CXO)
