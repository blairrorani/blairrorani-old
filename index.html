<h2>Hi, I'm Blair Rorani</h2>
<p>I help companies visualise and explain software, processes and ideas that so they're easier to understand.</p>

<p style="margin: 30px 0;"><img src="/images/visual-explanation-digital-transformation.png" alt="Sketch of how Dropbox works" /></p>

<p>The default way to explain things in business is to use crowded PowerPoint slides, boring technical overviews, jargon-filled emails and a lot of words. <i class="em em-cry"></i></p>

<p><strong>What if you had a simpler, more enaging way to explain new software, business processes and big ideas?</strong></p>

<p>I use visual artefacts, stories, games and other engaging, fun stuff to make information about your business easier to understand and apply.</p>

<h2>How I help</h2>
<p>I teach workshops, coach teams and create custom visual explanations. Here's what I offer.</p>
<h3><i class="em em-thinking_face" aria-role="presentation" aria-label="THINKING FACE"></i> Think</h3>
<p>I clarify what your team is building with maps, sketches, storyboards and visual prototypes.</p>

<h3><i class="em em-speech_balloon" aria-role="presentation" aria-label="SPEECH BALLOON"></i> Communicate</h3>
<p>I tell the story of your new software, process or idea with slides, illustrations and animations.</p>

<h3><i class="em em-brain" aria-role="presentation" aria-label="BRAIN"></i> Teach</h3>
<p>I design practical, visual guides and challenges to get your your team and your customers up to speed.</p>

Blair's ability as a visual thinker is exceptional. His skill to take complex information an distil it down to a visual graphic is like watching a magician.<br /><strong>Rhys F, CXO <i class="em em-male_mage" aria-role="presentation" aria-label=""></i> </strong>
