![Google's material design colour tool](/uploads/Screenshot%202018-03-12%2013.40.14.png)

Handy colour tool (or color as they say in the US) from Google's Material Design system. Basically you can choose a main / background colour and a complimentary highlight / foreground colour and see what the colours look like in various layouts.

Plus it does all the accessibility testing for you. üëç
