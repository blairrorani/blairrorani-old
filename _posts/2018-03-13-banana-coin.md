You might have heard of BitCoin, but have you heard of BananaCoin üçåüí∞? Basically a start up is accepting payment in cryptocurrency (BitCoin, etc) in exchange for their tokens which they've named BananaCoin. They can then use that cryptocurrency to fund the development of their business. This process is called an [initial coin offering or ICO](https://medium.com/@Crowdwiz.io/ico-for-beginners-learn-how-icos-work-and-what-theyre-about-dc01b5bf3c30).

If you decide to cash out, you can sell your BananaCoin for the market price or for a kg of Lady Finger bananas. Clearly a win-win scenario.
