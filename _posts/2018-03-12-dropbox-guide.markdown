The [Dropbox guide](https://www.dropbox.com/guide) designed by [Ueno](https://ueno.co/work/dropbox-guide) sort of mimics the feel of a printed manual. I like how it is more like a quick start guide that also has links to other support articles. That way you can still get the help you need without having to include everything in the guides.

Ueno won an award for the UI several years ago and I think it still works well on desktop and mobile.
