Nintendo's new Labo product reminds me of the DIY science kits that were popular when I was young. You could make your own radio or a door bell using a little toolkit that came with instructions and everything you needed.

Labo is similar except its for making your own toys.  And those toys integrate with Nintendo Switch's controllers, screens.
