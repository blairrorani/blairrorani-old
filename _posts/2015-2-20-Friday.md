I have a condition / superpower called [Chromo-Synesthesia](#). This means that I see colors when I am stimulated by other senses. Touch, smell, words, faces, ideas. It’s strongest when I’m listening to music. I used to think this was a normal thing that everybody had, until my friend Jake told me I was a freakazoid.
