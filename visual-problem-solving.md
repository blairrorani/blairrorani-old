Create a shared understanding of a problem, generate new ideas and then prototype and test solutions.

## What you normally get

- A lot of meetings
- Action points
- Scribbles on whiteboards
- Talking
- Untested assumptions and ideas
- Stick to existing solutions

Working in this way end up with slow progress, misaligned stakeholders, building "the same old thing" and confused users.

## What you get instead

- The Google Design Sprint process
- A map of the problem
- Sketches of new, creative ideas
- Storyboard of your favourite solution
- Visual, tangible prototype
- Testing and feedback

Get everyone solving the same problem, share information and ideas visually, and validate your ideas before you start building.
