<p>Give your teams practical, visual tools that explain the who, what, why and how of your strategy, processes, products and technologies.</p>
<h2>What you normally do</h2>
<ul>
<li>Bullets points</li>
<li>Tables</li>
<li>10 pt fonts</li>
<li>Emails</li>
<li>Town hall talks</li>
<li>"Click and complete" elearning</li>
<li>Information dumps</li>
</ul>
<p>This way of communicating is hard to understand, easy to ignore and a bit boring. Plus, people learn new skills through guided practise, not by doing elearning.</p>
<h2>What you'll get instead</h2>
<ul>
<li>Cool illustrations</li>
<li>Interesting stories</li>
<li>Animations</li>
<li>Visual workflow maps</li>
<li>Digital tools and guides</li>
<li>Fun, practical challenges and games</li>
</ul>
