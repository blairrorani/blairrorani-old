## Capture key insights and ideas at your next event

Most events are full of valuable insights and interesting ideas. The problem is that these insights and ideas aren't necessary on a speaker's slides (if they have slides). Sure you can take a video, but that means lots of fast forwarding to find the one or two gold nuggets.

Visual note-taking allows you to capture and share the most important and impactful parts of any talk or panel.

## Who takes visual notes?
Hi I'm [Blair Rorani](/about). I've been taking visual notes on my iPad since 2010. Over the years I've turned hundreds of insights and ideas from conferences and other events, into clear, engaging visuals.

## Visual notes
- Are a fun way to share insights and ideas with attendees
- Are easy to browse and understand (you have to read an entire written note to understand what it's about)
- Get lots of likes, shares and comments on social media
- Can be reused in blog posts as posters

Plus, I take visual notes on my iPad Pro so the notes are digital. This means they can be shared instantly or resized for posters or other formats. No need to take photos of a flip cart, reflective whiteboard or notebook. Notes can even be exported as short time-lapse animations that show each stroke being drawing.

### How does visual note-taking work?
1. I start by listening to who ever is speaking.
2. Next, I capture key insights and ideas using simple visuals.
3. Then, I share the images with you via Dropbox (or your preferred file sharing service)

If you'd like some of the notes turned into A3 posters for your speakers or to hang around the office, I can do that for you too.

### What industries can benefit from visual note-taking?
All of them. About 75% of the human brain is dedicated to processing visual information so it makes sense to make information visual in the first place. It doesn't matter which industry you're in.

### Want visual notes for your project kick-off meeting or workshop?
There are definitely huge benefits to making information and ideas visual in these contexts. In addition to taking free-form notes, there are some creative problem solving techniques that you can use to get everyone on the same page.

- Capturing information from expert interviews and lightning demos
- Mapping the context of your project from a customer or employee's perspective
- Visualising ideas
- Storyboarding prototypes

Again, [send me an email](mailto:blair@rorani.com) and we can talk more about the best way to help you and your team.

<!--### Can visual notes work at our project kick-off meeting?[^For v2]
Yes. Also, if you're kicking off a project you might benefit from some creative [problem solving tools](link-to-creative-problem-solving-skill-set) that allow you to visualise information and ideas at different stages of your project. -->
