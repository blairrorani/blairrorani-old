Whether or not you have a website I can make sure it's easy for people to view and interact with it on their mobile devices. Plus it will look cool.

This website isn't mobile-friendly
<p class="u-c-txt">![mobile-unfriendly website on mobile phone not using responsive web design]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/mobile-unfriendly-website.png)

*See how part of the page is cut off on a smaller screen?*

## Example B
This website is mobile-friendly.

**Hello I'm Blair**. I've been building websites for over a decade. These days I only build websites on a referral basis. That means someone I know must have sent you to this page :) Kia ora!

As you've learnt today, websites need to work on smaller phone or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phablet" target="_blank">phablet</a> screens. They also need to look good on the <a href="http://www.apple.com/au/imac-with-retina/" target="_blank">larger displays</a>.

## Proof is in the pudding
Here are a couply websites I've built recently:

* [Integrite](http://integrite.net)
* [Mita Squash](http://mitasquash.com)
* [NZ Body Mechanic](http://nzbodymechanic.co.nz)
* [Blair Rorani](http://blair.rorani.com)

**Remember:** These websites look and work the way they do because that's what the clients wanted. Your site can look <a href="http://www.cornify.com/" target="_blank">however you want it to</a>, we'll sort that out as part of the process.

**Notes:**

* These prices are half-price because you were referred to me by a friend.
* Prices are in AUD if you live in Australia and NZD if you live in Aotearoa and USD if you live in the States. GST only applies *if you live in Australia*.
* All work includes a set of hand-drawn sketches, a final draft and a final version. That means you get two chances to make changes.
