Blair Rorani has been learning new things and teaching them to others since 2003. The official title for someone who does this is 'instructional designer' but he prefers 'designer of educational things'.

His guides, infographics, animations, online courses, workshops and websites have been used to educate tens of thousands of people about things like financial services, digital technology, telecommunications, energy, commodity trading, transport, sales, leadership and health and safety.

Along the way he's learned valuable lessons about how to communicate visually, how to make decisions and solve problems as a team, how to understand (and use) digital technology and, most importantly, how to learn new things quickly.

Now Blair teaches these lessons to others at [Kea School](http://keaschool.com), an educational 'company of one'.

(He also draws [a ton of pics](https://www.pinterest.com/blairrorani) on his iPad.)
