Blair Rorani has been learning new things and teaching them to others since 2003. The official title for someone who does this is 'instructional designer' but he prefers 'designer of educational things'.

He's designed educational illustrations, animations, guides, infographics, digital tools, online courses, websites and workshops that have helped tens of thousands of people in financial services, telecommunications, health, and the Government, to learn new skills.

Along the way he's learned valuable lessons about how to communicate visually, how to make decisions and solve problems as a team, how to understand and use digital technology, and most importantly, how to learn new things quickly.

Now Blair teaches these lessons to others at Kea School.

(He also draws [a ton of pics](https://www.pinterest.com.au/blairrorani/visual-note-taking/) on his iPad.)
