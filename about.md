## Blair makes things that help people get better at stuff
The official title for someone who does this is "instructional designer" but he prefers "designer of educational things".

Anyways, his guides, infographics, animations, online courses, workshops and websites have been used to educate tens of thousands of people about things like financial services, telecommunications, digital technology, energy, commodity trading, health, sales and leadership.

He also takes tons of [notes on his iPad](/visual-note-taking).
