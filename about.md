My mission is to make it easier for anyone to understand and use technology. <i class="em em-star-struck"></i>

I've designed simple, visual resources to help people understand and use mobile banking apps, billing software, births / deaths /  marriages record keeping software, cloud computing platforms, customer relationship management software (CRMs), fintech (e.g. blockchain, crowdfunding),  financial wellbeing tools, team collaboration platforms, virtual hosting platforms and workplace productivity apps.

I've also taken [visual notes](/visual-note-taking/) at tech talks and events.
